# exoscale_network

The `exoscale_network` resource manages a [Private Network][privnet], a
virtual L2 network segment shared only among Compute instances attached to it.

Note: the *managed* Private Network feature is currently only available in the
`CH-GVA-2` zone.

[privnet]: https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/compute/private-networks/

## Usage

```hcl
resource "exoscale_network" "unmanaged" {
  name = "myPrivNet"
  display_text = "description"
  zone = "ch-gva-2"
  network_offering = "PrivNet"

  tags = {
    # ...
  }
}
```

the `CH-GVA-2` zone):
